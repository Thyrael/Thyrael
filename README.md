### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Robin, Full Stack engineer** working in Lille, France.

------------

After bad professional experiences in development, I regained faith in development and open source in 2020 (thanks to my colleague and friend [@Jerome1337](https://github.com/Jerome1337)).  I'm now working with him on open source side projects with our Github organization named **Los-Crackitos**.

I love Golang and his environment and i appreciate JavaScript, in particular SvelteJs and ReactJS.

I'm currently working on python/react-native project and to the developpment of our meetup [Lille-Gophers](https://lille-gophers.loscrackitos.codes/).
